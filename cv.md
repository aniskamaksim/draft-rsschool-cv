function collectAllNumbersInInterval(firstNumber, secondNumber) {
    let result = " "; //result will contain the list of all numbers between the firstNumber and secondNumber
    if (firstNumber > secondNumber) {
        for (let i = firstNumber; i >= secondNumber; i--)
            result += firstNumber-- + " ";
        firstNumber--;
    } else if (secondNumber > firstNumber) {
        for (let i = secondNumber; i >= firstNumber; i--)
            result += secondNumber-- + " ";
        secondNumber--;
    } else if (firstNumber === secondNumber) {
        result = firstNumber;
    }
    return result;
}
```

```

function testCycle(n) {
    const resheto = [];
    const num = [];
    for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        if (!resheto[i]) {
            num.push(i);
            for (let j = i * 2; j < n; j += i) {
                resheto[j] = true;
            }
        }
